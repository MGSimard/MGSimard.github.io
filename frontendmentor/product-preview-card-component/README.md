### What I learned

- Picture tag
- That when FrontEndMentor's style guide says "Font weight is 700" it really actually means something else entirely and your result will differ from the provided design image for the sake of making it more obnoxious than necessary to sell you access to Figma files which I will most definitely never do thank you enjoy the slightly less bold title
