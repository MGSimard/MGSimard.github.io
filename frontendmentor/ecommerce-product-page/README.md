## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Chocolate & Vanilla

### Continued development

Plan better instead of adjusting on the fly, had to redo some things multiple times because I jumped straight into it, mostly picked this for the sake of the lightbox stuff since I wanted to make one for my portfolio website.
