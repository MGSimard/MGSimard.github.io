## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- No Javascript (Bonus Objective)
- Still my homie Brackets

### What I learned

- Details disclosure elements to make javascript-less accordions.
- Animating a picture when hovering an unrelated element by making them siblings behind the scenes & without utilizing Javascript (details:hover ~ #desktop-box)

### Continued development

Continue to refuse paying money for access to the figma design files and just keep taking screenshots of the app + overlay them on top of the design pictures at 50% opacity on GIMP to correct differences

### Useful resources

- [Details Disclosure Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)
(HTML disclosure tag, creates a JS-less accordion)
