## About The Project

![Portfolio Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/UPd52Bi.jpeg)

This V2 was coded purely in vanilla html/css/js using Adobe Brackets before picking up React, VSCode, Git and all that. Should contain my main projects up to current date, along with my old challenges from freeCodeCamp & Frontend Mentor. Also contains gamedev stuff I do as a hobby.

I plan on eventually developing a new portfolio based on React.
